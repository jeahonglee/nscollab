## Overview

NS Collab Platform aims to solve the challenge of persistent connection and collaboration within the Network School community. Current methods like meetups and Discord are ephemeral. This platform provides a dedicated space to:

- Discover fellow NS members, their skills, and interests.
- Catalog, track, and collaborate on project ideas.
- Prevent redundant discovery efforts each cohort.
- Facilitate meaningful connections and team formation.
- Preserve institutional knowledge across NS cohorts.

The platform is intended for **internal use by NS members only**.

## Features

Based on the [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./docs/PRD.md), key features include:

- **Secure Authentication:** Sign-in via Google, Apple, Discord using Supabase Auth.
- **Detailed User Profiles:** Showcase skills, background, NS participation history, social links, project interests, and availability status (e.g., `Looking for Co-founder`, `Building for Fun`). Includes auto-generated `nspals.com` link.
- **Idea Management:**
  - Submit project ideas with descriptions.
  - Track idea status (Ideation, Building, Launched, etc.).
  - Form teams around ideas.
  - Specify needs (e.g., `Need Designer`, `Need Frontend Dev`).
  - Comment/update feed for ongoing discussion and activity tracking.
- **Discovery:**
  - **Members Directory:** Searchable and filterable member list.
  - **Idea Hub:** Browseable ideas via List, Kanban views with filtering/sorting.
- **Privacy:** Platform access restricted to authenticated NS members.

_(Refer to `docs/PRD.md` for full feature details)_

## Setup and Run Locally

This project was initialized using the `create-next-app` template with Supabase integration (`--example with-supabase`).

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Node.js (Version recommended by Next.js 15)
    - npm, yarn, or pnpm
    - A [Supabase account and project](https://database.new).

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory> # e.g., cd ns-collab
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
    - Update the file with your Supabase project details:

      ```dotenv
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]

      # You will also need Client IDs and Secrets for your chosen OAuth providers
      # Add them here as needed, e.g.:
      # DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...
      # DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=...
      ```

    - Find `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your [Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api).
    - **Important:** Ensure you configure the necessary OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Discord) within your Supabase project's Authentication settings, including setting up the correct Redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` for local development).

5.  **Set up Supabase Database:**

    - Apply the necessary database schema. You can use the SQL definitions potentially found in `supabase/migrations` (if using Supabase CLI) or define them manually via the Supabase dashboard. Refer to the schema defined in `docs/DEV-CHECKLIST.md` (Phase 2).
    - **Crucially, set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies** as outlined in the `DEV-CHECKLIST.md` to ensure data privacy and proper access control.

6.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

7.  **(Optional) Shadcn/UI Styles:**
    - This template comes with the default `shadcn/ui` style. If you want a different theme, delete `components.json` and re-initialize `shadcn/ui` following their [documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next).
